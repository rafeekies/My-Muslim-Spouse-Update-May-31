      question: 'How does My Muslim Spouse ensure Islamic principles are followed?',
      answer: 'My Muslim Spouse is designed with Islamic principles at its core. We enforce strict modesty guidelines, provide Islamic resources, and ensure all interactions follow Islamic etiquette. Our platform facilitates family involvement in the process and provides educational content on Islamic marriage practices.',
      category: 'islamic'
    },
    {
      id: 2,

      category: 'matching'
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: 'How is my privacy protected on the platform?',

      answer: 'Your profile should include honest information about your religious practices, education, family background, interests, and what you\'re looking for in a spouse.

      category: 'registration'
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: 'How does the matching system work?',
      answer: 'Our matching system uses both your stated preferences and Islamic compatibility factors. We consider religious values, life goals, education, and family background. You\'ll receive quality matches rather than endless profiles to browse. You can also set deal-breakers that will automatically filter incompatible matches.',
      category: 'matching'
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: 'What communication options are available?',
      answer: 'We offer text-based messaging, supervised chat rooms where family members can be present, and virtual meeting spaces. All communication tools are designed to maintain Islamic etiquette and modesty while allowing you to get to know potential spouses in a halal environment.',

    {
      id: 7,
      question: 'Is there a verification process for users?',

    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: 'What Islamic resources are available on the platform?',
      answer: 'We provide articles, videos, and guides on Islamic marriage, spouse selection criteria, rights and responsibilities in marriage, and how to conduct the search process in an Islamically appropriate manner. We also offer access to qualified scholars who can answer specific questions.',
      category: 'islamic'
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: 'Can I hide my profile temporarily?',
      answer: 'Yes, you can pause your profile visibility at any time without losing your information or connections. This is useful if you\'re getting to know someone seriously or need a break from the search process.',
      category: 'registration'
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: 'How can I report inappropriate behavior?',
      answer: 'We have a zero-tolerance policy for un-Islamic behavior. You can report any concerns through the "Report" button available on profiles and in messages. Our moderation team reviews all reports within 24 hours and takes appropriate action.',
